Refering all the organization's system/ variables [The Infomation Syatem Orgaization, Provide Support, Purchasing Organizaton, Supply Management Strategy and Their Key Elements, Time foe Transformational Thinking, Forming the SiL'K Project Team, Mapping, Modern Technology Considerations] 

The outcome was favouring to imply the provider second functionalities to automate management. The active reason was the strong background supporting the predictive insights, contract management, categories that perfectly meet our RFQ, and highly rated education. Meanwhile, as compared to the other provides, provider 2 has the least weakness varibles; cost and platform profitability.

However, the strategy failed. Not only the provider 2 was not a successful option but also the other contenders was not optimum. What could be the possible reason?

First and formost, gained the deeper business understanding for Harley-Davidson. In the one hand, the insght provided the information that each IS Director was deeply integrated into the business and leveraged technology to drive strategic value. On the other hand, the founders were more fouced on their bikes and generational followed work culture.

Secondly, by framing the problem, altering the management for automation was clearly not aligning with the founders's desire. As, it would shift the Harley-Davidson Vikings Land personality into corporate following procedures.

In the nutshell, to get the desired outcome. Corporated officials has to step back with the 30% of the strategies to maintain the organization's work culture, and get the optimum output that satisfies the operations as well as management.
